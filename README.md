## Description
This project demonstrates the ability to use Javascript to set web page styles. The eyes follow your mouse cursor as you move it around the screen

### How to Run
This will run locally in your browser from index.html if you download all files and ensure they're located in the same directory as each other and have the same file structure (i.e. images folder with separately stored images.) Alternately, you can see it in action <a href="https://jayeclark.github.io/eyes-animation/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Planned Future Improvements
- [ ] Change the math on the movement so that the eyes focus on a point 10" in front of the screen
- [X] Use CSS to add eyelashes
- [ ] Use CSS to add iris details
- [ ] Add pupil reflection that moves as the eyes move
- [ ] Use CSS to add blinking eyelids
